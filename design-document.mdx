This is a technical design document for readers that are already familiar with public key infrastructure (PKI) and certificate management and want to get up to speed with _step certificates_ quickly.

For readers who are less familiar check out...

- [Everything you should know about certificates and PKI but are too afraid to ask](https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki.html)
- [The case for TLS everywhere](https://smallstep.com/blog/use-tls.html)

## About the `step` toolchain

`step` is the command-line interface for all things smallstep, and a swiss-army knife for day-to-day Production Identity operations.

`step` is a command-line tool for developers, operators, and security professionals to:

- configure, operate, and automate all of smallstep's tools, and
- work with open standard Production Identity technologies

It's the open source core of everything smallstep does, and everything you need to work with certificates, tokens, JOSE structures (JWT, JWK, JWE, JWS), and many other common cryptography primitives.

#### `step` Characteristics

- **Easy to use, hard to misuse:** Safe defaults everywhere encourage best practices by always making the right thing easy. Insecure or subtle operations are gated with flags to prevent accidental misuse.

- **Help that's actually helpful:** Run `step help` on any subcommand to find thorough documentation, examples for common use cases, and in-depth discussion of relevant security, architectural, and general usage considerations.

- **Developer friendly:** Thoughtfully designed to be intuitive, get the job done, and get out of the way. With `step` , complex security operations become simple and obvious.

- **Opinionated, but flexible:** make easy things easy and hard things possible
- **Standards-based:** _step certificates_ is mostly vanilla, with some sprinkles

---

#### Things you can do with `step`

- Verify and inspect JWTs
- Get an OAuth access token or OpenID Connect identity token to access APIs
- Get TLS certificates from `step-ca`
- Install root certificates and issue locally-trusted development certificates
- Inspect and lint X.509 certificates
- Encrypt data using JWE or NaCl
- Login to SSH using `step-ssh`

[_Step certificates_](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/ 'step certificates on Github') extends the [step command line tool](https://github.com/smallstep/cli/ 'step CLI on Github'), adding a certificate authority ( `step-ca` ) and subcommands to make secure automated certificate management easy. 
The goal is to reduce the cost of building an internal PKI to cryptographically identify people, devices, and production workloads (e.g., microservices) and use TLS.

While end-to-end cryptography and mutual authentication between services is valuable, it's too hard with legacy tools. 
This difficulty is not inherent -- PKI is not _necessarily_ hard. 
But there is an infrastructure and tooling gap that makes internal PKI challenging._Step certificates_ fills that gap.

_Step certificates_ has two core components:

- The `step-ca` binary is an **certificate authority** (CA) service that you run yourself. It exposes a JSON/HTTPS **API for automating certificate management** (certificate signing/issuance, renewal, and revocation).
- The `step` binary is a **command line security utility** for working with standards like X.509, JWT, and OAuth. It's an easy-to-use `openssl` replacement for many common use cases. It also does some things that `openssl` and similar tools can't. Apropos of the current discussion, `step` **integrates with the `step-ca` API** to streamline certificate management workflows, making automation even easier.

Both of these programs are written in golang and use the excellent [crypto](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/ 'golang crypto') and [x509](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/x509/ 'x509') libraries from the golang standard library. They also use square's [go-jose](https://github.com/square/go-jose 'go-jose') library for [JOSE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/jose/about/ 'JOSE') primitives (JWT & JWK).

These tools make the arcane art of automated certificate management a simple, intuitive process. With _step certificates_ you should be able to **setup your own internal CA and automate the delivery of certificates to your production workloads in an afternoon**.

#### Key Features

- An internal certificate authority (CA) that can issue certificates to workloads, devices, and people
- Streamlined generation of artifacts required for an internal CA - Automatically builds root & intermediate certificates and private keys
- A variety of authentication mechanisms for provisioning certificates in different environments
- A command line tool for generating keys, working with cryptographic artifacts, and interacting with the CA to automate certificate issuance, renewal, and revocation
- Proven industry defaults for easy secure choices including root and intermediate private key hygiene
- Automated certificate renewal to empower best practices of issuing short-lived (e.g.24-hour) certificates.
- Passive revocation to avoid the challenges of implementing infrastructure support for active revocation.
- Key pair generation to create a public key that can be distributed and shared with the world and a corresponding private key that should be kept confidential by the owner.
- If you don't like our defaults and you want more control, fear not, everything is highly configurable. A design goal of `step certificates` is to make easy things easy and hard things possible.

#### Installing

Installing `step` and `step-ca` is easy. If you're on macOS you can simply

```bash
brew install step
```

For Linux installation and custom builds see the installation instructions in the [step](https://github.com/smallstep/cli/#installation-guide 'Instructions') and [step certificates](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates/#installation-guide 'step certs install guide') repositories.

If you're using Docker or Kubernetes we also have [pre-built containers](https://hub.docker.com/u/smallstep 'docker hub') and [helm charts](https://hub.helm.sh/charts/smallstep 'Helm Hub') available.

We're not currently testing `step` and `step-ca` on Microsoft operating systems, but they should mostly work (though you will need to build the binaries yourself). We are interested in issues if you encounter any.

## Overview & Design

Let's consider a simple concrete example: using _step certificates_ to issue certificates to two microservices so they can communicate securely using HTTPS.

Assume our two services -- `foo.internal` and `bar.internal` -- currently communicate using plain HTTP:

![Foo & Bar speaking HTTP](https://i.imgur.com/A6kXsmo.png 'Foo & Bar speaking HTTP')

Our goal is to switch to mutually authenticated HTTPS (HTTP over mutual TLS). Most proxies and standard library HTTP stacks support mutual HTTPS. But each service will need three artifacts to speak HTTPS:

- Your certificate authority's (CA's) **root certificate**
- A **private key**, and
- A **certificate** signed by your CA

The certificate and private key are credentials used for authentication. The root certificate verifies these credentials.

Once everything is deployed our system will look like:

![Foo & Bar speaking HTTPS](https://i.imgur.com/r2AQPZV.png 'Foo & Bar speaking HTTPS')

Let's use _step certificates_ ( `step` and `step-ca` ) to generate and deploy these artifacts.

#### Creating PKI artifacts and starting `step-ca`

Before we can deploy a root certificate we need to create one, along with a corresponding private key. The `step ca init` command does this. It also generates a configuration file for `step-ca` and registers a _provisioner_ (discussed in the next section):

```bash
ca$ echo "p4ss" > password.txt

ca$ step ca init --name "Smallstep" --provisioner admin \
                    --dns "ca.internal" --address ":443" \
                    --password-file password.txt \
                    --provisioner-password-file password.txt

Generating root certificate... all done!

Generating intermediate certificate... all done!

✔ Root certificate: certs/root_ca.crt
✔ Root private key: secrets/root_ca_key
✔ Root fingerprint: 0601bb45459f9e8230b6f09cd9e69c746669fd82e960fe421b7af0cdfd329ac2
✔ Intermediate certificate: certs/intermediate_ca.crt
✔ Intermediate private key: secrets/intermediate_ca_key
✔ Default configuration: config/defaults.json
✔ Certificate Authority configuration: config/ca.json

Your PKI is ready to go. To generate certificates for individual services see 'step help ca'.
```

This command generates all of the PKI artifacts and configuration files needed to run `step-ca` :

```bash
ca$ tree $(step path)
~/.step
├── certs
│   ├── intermediate_ca.crt
│   └── root_ca.crt
├── config
│   ├── ca.json
│   └── defaults.json
└── secrets
    ├── intermediate_ca_key
    └── root_ca_key
```

The `--name` flag specifies a human-readable name for your CA infrastructure. It forms part of the subject name in your newly generated root and intermediate certificates:

```bash
ca$ step certificate inspect --short $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt
X.509v3 Root CA Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 1319...2560]
    Subject:     Smallstep Root CA
    Issuer:      Smallstep Root CA
    Valid from:  2019-06-14T21:42:43Z
            to:  2029-06-11T21:42:43Z

ca$ step certificate inspect --short $(step path)/certs/intermediate_ca.crt
X.509v3 Root CA Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 1319...2560]
    Subject:     Smallstep Intermediate CA
    Issuer:      Smallstep Root CA
    Valid from:  2019-06-14T21:42:43Z
            to:  2029-06-11T21:42:43Z
```

The use of an intermediate certificate and signing key is a PKI best practice that enables certain advanced PKI use cases. You can safely ignore this aspect of the system until you need it: the key generation and bundling required to make intermediates work is handled for you by `step` and `step-ca` .

It's important to keep the root and intermediate signing keys secure. Both keys are encrypted on disk using a password read from `--password-file` (if this flag isn't provided you'll be prompted for a password). You can change the password on these keys using `step crypto change-pass` .

The root signing key is not actually needed for `step-ca` to operate. You can remove it from `$(step path)/secrets/root_ca_key` and keep it securely offline, if you'd prefer.

The `--dns` flag specifies the DNS host name for the CA. The CA exposes an HTTPS API and issues itself an end-entity certificate using this name. The CA listens on the IP address and port specified by the `--address` flag.

```bash
ca$ step certificate inspect https://ca.internal \
        --short --roots $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2471...9110]
    Subject:     Step Online CA
                ca.internal
    Issuer:      Smallstep Intermediate CA
    Valid from:  2019-06-14T21:42:49Z
            to:  2019-06-15T21:42:49Z
```

> Note: you'll need to configure `ca.internal` to resolve to the right IP address in DNS. You can use `localhost` as your CA's DNS name for testing.

We're ready to start `step-ca` :

```bash
$ step-ca $(step path)/config/ca.json --password-file password.txt
```

> Note: `step path` is a helper command that outputs the filesystem path used to store `step` configuration files, certificates, and keys. This will default to `~/.step` but can be configured using the `STEPPATH` environment variable.

## Automated certificate management

The `step` command line utility integrates with the `step-ca` HTTPS APIs to help:

- Distribute your root certificate,
- Generate key pairs, and
- Obtain certificates for workloads

#### Distributing your Root Certificate

Like any other TLS/HTTPS client, `step` needs your CA's root certificate to verify issued certificates and establish secure connections. This presents a challenge: we'd like to use HTTPS to connect to the CA and obtain our root certificate, but we need the root certificate to establish this secure connection.

When we ran `step ca init` our _root certificate fingerprint_ was printed. This fingerprint is a hash over our root certificate. `step` can use this fingerprint to securely obtain the root certificate from the CA:

```bash
foo$ step ca root root_ca.crt \
        --ca-url https://ca.internal \
        --fingerprint 0601bb45459f9e8230b6f09cd9e69c746669fd82e960fe421b7af0cdfd329ac2
The root certificate has been saved in root_ca.crt.
```

> Note: you can regenerate this fingerprint by running `step certificate fingerprint $(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt` on your CA.

Technically, the `step ca root` command proceeds by making an HTTPS request to the CA with [_certificate path validation_](https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki.html#certificate-path-validation 'path validation') turned off. This is usually insecure. However, `step` immediately re-computes the fingerprint over the received root certificate and compares it to the expected value. Next, `step` runs certificate path validation on the end-entity certificate presented by the CA, using the newly validated root certificate. If there's a fingerprint mismatch, or if certificate path validation fails, `step ca root` fails.

The upshot is: if `step ca root` exits successfully you can be sure you've connected to `ca.internal` and obtained the correct root certificate (identified by `--fingerprint` ).

This command can be baked into an AMI, run in a [cloud VM startup script](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript 'vm script'), a [kubernetes init container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/ 'Init container'), or by a configuration management tool like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet. Alternatively, you can bake your root certificate directly into an AMI. But using `step ca root` makes federation and root certificate rotation easier.

With the root certificate securely distributed, our next task is to have `foo.local` generate a key pair and obtain a certificate from `step-ca` . To do that, we'll need to use a _provisioner_.

### Provisioners

The certificate signing API exposed by `step-ca` requires mutual authentication. The CA authenticates to the client using a certificate (which the client verifies using the root certificate we obtained in the last step). But the client must also authenticate to the CA. Again, this presents a challenge: the client obviously can't use a certificate for authentication because it doesn't have one yet.

To verify the legitimacy of certificate signing requests, we need some entity that the CA trusts to measure and attest to the identity of our workloads. In the _step certificates_ architecture this entity is called a _provisioner_, because it helps to provision certificates.

In general, once a _provisioner_ authenticates a workload's identity it issues the workload a _bearer token_ to submit to the CA, along with a [certificate signing request](https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki.html#certificate-signing-requests 'CSR') (CSR), to obtain a certificate. The _bearer token_ authenticates the workload and authorizes the certificate request.

![Generic Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/zH4RYEj.png 'Generic Architecture')

The details of how a provisioner interacts with a workload (or device or person) and the CA vary by provisioner type. Smallstep supports a number of provisioner types including, AWS Instance Identity Documents, Google Cloud Instance Identity Tokens, the Azure Instance Metadata Service, OAuth/OIDC Single Sign-on, and JWT for building custom integrations.

#### IID Provisioner

For cloud VMs running on AWS, GCP, or Azure `step-ca` can be configured to use _instance identity documents_ (IIDs) to authorize certificate signing requests. IIDs make integrating `step certificates` even easier: instead of building and integrating a JWK provisioner that issues tokens to workloads, `step` can request tokens directly from your cloud provider's _metadata API_ with no additional infrastructure requirements:

![IID Provisioner Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/pdeFC1g.png 'IID Provisioner Architecture')

Once you've configured `step-ca` [to use IIDs for authentication](/docs/step-ca/configuration#cloud-provisioners), `step` will detect the provisioner type, obtain an IID token from your cloud provider, and use it to obtain a certificate from `step-ca` automatically.

First, bootstrap `foo.internal` if you haven't already:

```bash
foo$ step ca bootstrap --ca-url https://ca.internal \
                        --fingerprint 0601bb45459f9e8230b6f09cd9e69c746669fd82e960fe421b7af0cdfd329ac2
The root certificate has been saved in certs/root_ca.crt.
Your configuration has been saved in config/defaults.json.
```

Then request a certificate, specifying the name of your IID provisioner as the `--issuer` (in this case `"Google Cloud"` ):

```bash
foo$ step ca certificate foo.internal foo.crt foo.key --issuer "Google Cloud"
✔ CA: https://ca.internal
✔ Certificate: foo.crt
✔ Private Key: foo.key
```

#### OAuth/OIDC Single Sign-on Provisioner

Occasionally it's useful to issue certificates to people (e.g., for testing and debugging). To facilitate this, `step-ca` can be [configured to use OAuth/OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/docs/step-ca/configuration#oauthoidc-single-sign-on 'OIDC') _identity tokens_ for authentication. In other words, you can use single sign-on with GSuite, Okta, Active Directory, or any other OAuth OIDC provider to get a certificate:

![SSO Provisioner Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/OIX5Wav.png 'SSO Provisioner Architecture')

Again, `step` detects the provisioner type selected and initiates the OAuth flow automatically:

```bash
$ step ca certificate mike@smallstep.com mike.crt mike.key
✔ Key ID: 650445034027-jsjdrkiskeq9ke99ud2rqkst82ft8uch.apps.googleusercontent.com (Google)
✔ CA: https://ca.internal
✔ Certificate: mike.crt
✔ Private Key: mike.key
```

When an OIDC provisioner is selected for use by `step ca token` or `step ca certificate` an OAuth flow is automatically initiated in your local web browser.

By default the issued certificate will use the subject ( `sub` ) claim from the _identity token_ as the certificate subject. The value of the `email` claim is also included as an email SAN in the certificate.

```bash
$ step certificate inspect --short mike.crt
X.509v3 TLS Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 2581...6739]
    Subject:     115449349109627210866
                mike@smallstep.com
    Issuer:      Smallstep Intermediate CA
    Provisioner: Google [ID: 6504....com]
    Valid from:  2019-06-20T18:21:52Z
            to:  2019-06-21T18:21:52Z
```

When you configure an OIDC provisioner at the CA you can also specify a list of `admins` . These users will be allowed to request certificates with any name (non-admins can only get certificates binding their own ID and email address).

#### JWK Provisioner

The JWK provisioner is the most generic provisioner type. It's useful for building custom integrations with infrastructure like Puppet, Chef, Ansible, and Kubernetes. JWK provisioners issue workloads single-use short-lived JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authorize certificate signing requests.

Because the JWTs issued by JWT provisioners are short-lived and single-use they have reasonably good security characteristics: a token that's intercepted and misused is easily detected by the intended recipient when their certificate request fails.

To create a JWK provisioner you generate a key pair, represented as a JSON Web Key (JWK), and register the public key with the CA. Optionally, the CA can escrow the corresponding private key (symmetrically encrypted with a password).

![JWK Provisioner Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/7a97FrJ.png 'JWK Provisioner Architecture')

A JWK provisioner was created automatically for us when we ran `step ca init` . We named this provisioner `admin` using the `--provisioner` flag. The private key was encrypted using the password from `--provisioner-password-file` and escrowed with the CA.

To add another JWK provisioner see `step help ca provisioner add` .

The `step ca token` subcommand integrates with `step-ca` to make token generation easy. Before we can use this subcommand, our provisioner needs to be _bootstrapped_ into our PKI:

```bash
provisioner$ step ca bootstrap --ca-url https://ca.internal \
                                --fingerprint 0601bb45459f9e8230b6f09cd9e69c746669fd82e960fe421b7af0cdfd329ac2
The root certificate has been saved in certs/root_ca.crt.
Your configuration has been saved in config/defaults.json.
```

Like `step ca root` , the `step ca bootstrap` command securely fetches the root certificate from the CA. It stores the certificate in a well-known location on disk where `step` can find it (under `~/.step` by default). It also configures `step` to connect to your CA by default, so you don't need to pass the `--ca-url` and `--root` flags all the time.

Once bootstrapped, we can use `step ca token` to generate a bearer token for `foo.local` :

```bash
$ echo "pass" > password.txt

$ step ca token foo.local --issuer admin --password-file password.txt

```

This token can be securely transmitted to `foo.local` (e.g., using SSH) and used to obtain a certificate:

```bash
foo$ step ca certificate foo.local foo.crt foo.key --token eyJhbGciOiJFUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IkVNdzJUSmFPS0NiTWUzQ1FLajJRRmF1WTkwNmZuZDNRajItTk8wVFdOS0UiLCJ0eXAiOiJKV1QifQ.eyJhdWQiOiJodHRwczovL2xvY2FsaG9zdC8xLjAvc2lnbiIsImV4cCI6MTU2MTA1MzA4MSwiaWF0IjoxNTYxMDUyNzgxLCJpc3MiOiJhZG1pbiIsImp0aSI6IjNiZmFhMzczMmI1N2Y5YTJjOTU3ZDg0MzJkMzA3N2EyZmE4MjkyMzhmYzcyYmZkOTE4YTNiMTFhMzdhMzc1YjYiLCJuYmYiOjE1NjEwNTI3ODEsInNhbnMiOlsiZm9vLmxvY2FsIl0sInNoYSI6IjQ4MjdmZWI4YjNlYmNlYzhkYzc3NmQwNmQ5MmJkZDQ0YzY3ZWQ0MWI5MGQ2NTdjYjdiNTU5Y2QyMTUwNWQ3NjQiLCJzdWIiOiJmb28ubG9jYWwifQ.Kahp9zB8kFZh1GO5Zto1r35Qj5at-RBQhAQRAAPm-mmx1tRXfJtHgAWy0RoRvxqd6AtFrYPiTOfAQTg1nubowA
✔ CA: https://ca.internal
✔ Certificate: foo.crt
✔ Private Key: foo.key
```

At this point, `foo.local` has everything it needs to speak HTTPS!

The `root_ca.crt` we obtained earlier via `step ca root` :

```bash
foo$ step certificate inspect --short root_ca.crt
X.509v3 Root CA Certificate (ECDSA P-256) [Serial: 1319...2560]

```

Along with a private key, and a certificate issued by our CA, generated and obtained via `step ca certificate` using a JWK provisioner token issued using `step ca token` :

JWTs are also easy to [generate programmatically](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io 'generate JWT'), without using `step` . The JWT audience ( `aud` ) should be the `/1.0/sign` endpoint for your CA. The JWT subject ( `sub` ) specifies the subject common name for the issued certificate. The `sha` and `sans` claims are non-standard: they specify the root certificate fingerprint and any subject alternative name(s) that are authorized for inclusion in the issued certificate.

```bash
foo$ step ca token foo.internal | step crypto jwt inspect --insecure

## What happens when `step ca certificate` runs?

The `step ca bootstrap` and `step ca certificate` commands belie a lot of complexity. Let's look at how they work in more depth.

`step ca bootstrap --ca-url <ca-url> --fingerprint <fingerprint>` downloads the root certificate and configures `step` to connect to your CA:

- The root certificate is retrieved via an HTTPS GET request to `https://<ca-url>/1.0/root/<fingerprint>` with certificate path validation disabled; the end-entity certificate presented by the CA (the CA's certificate) is retained for later validation
- The root certificate authenticity is verified by re-computing its fingerprint and comparing it to the expected `<fingerprint>`
- The CA's identity is authenticated by performing certificate path validation over the end-entity certificate retained earlier, using our newly obtained root certificate
- If root certificate or CA identity authentication fail, an error is returned. Otherwise,
  - The root certificate is stored in `$(step path)/certs/root_ca.crt`
  - The `$(step path)/config/defaults.json` configuration file is updated, setting the `ca-url` , `fingerprint` , and `root` attributes to the `<ca-url>` , `<fingerprint>` , and root certificate path, respectively

`step ca certificate <identity> <crt-file> <key-file>` generates a keypair, constructs a CSR, and obtains a certificate from the CA:

- The `$(step path)/config/defaults.json` file is interrogated to determine the default `ca-url` and root certificate (these can be configured manually via the `--ca-url` and `--root` flags, respectively)
  - _Note: the root certificate is used for all HTTPS requests to authenticate the CA's identity; to ensure you're connecting to the right CA_
- An HTTPS GET request to `https://<ca-url>/1.0/provisioners` to obtain a list of provisioners; the user is prompted to select which provisioner they'd like to use
- If a JWK provisioner is selected
  - The escrowed private key is obtained from the CA via an HTTPS GET request to `/provisioners/<provisioner-id>/encrypted-key`
  - The user is prompted to enter the password to decrypt the provisioner's private key
  - The decrypted key is used to generate a short-lived single-use JWT authorizing certificate issuance
- If an OAuth provisioner is selected
  - An HTTP server is started on localhost to handle an OAuth OIDC callback
  - An OAuth OIDC flow is initiated
  - The user authenticates and authorizes the request in their browser and is redirected to the callback URL on localhost
  - An OAuth OIDC _identity token_ with an appropriate audience is obtained, authorizing certificate issuance
- If an IID provisioner is selected
  - An _instance identity document_ is obtained from your cloud provider's metadata service, authorizing certificate issuance
- A _key pair_ (public and private key) is generated
- A _certificate signing request_ (CSR) is constructed, including `<identity>` and the newly generated pubic key, and signed by the newly generated private key
- An HTTPS POST request is submitted to `https://<ca-url>/1.0/sign` with the CSR and a credential authorizing the request (JWT, identity token, or instance identity document) included in the request body
- The CA verifies the CSR and the credential and responds with a signed certificate
- The certificate is stored in `<crt-file>` and the corresponding private key is stored in `<key-file>`

### Renewing a certificate

Certificates expire. By default, `step certificates` follows PKI best practices by issuing short-lived certificates that expire after 24 hours.

But your workloads will likely live longer than 24 hours. To keep your workloads up you'll need to _renew_ certificates before expiration. Again, `step` can help:

```bash
foo$ step ca renew --force foo.crt foo.key
Your certificate has been saved in foo.crt.
```

The `--daemon` flag makes `step ca renew` even more useful. Instead of running once and exiting, this flag tells `step ca renew` to stay running, continuously monitoring the certificate and renewing it before expiration:

```bash
foo$ step ca renew --force --daemon foo.crt foo.key
INFO: 2019/06/20 12:36:54 first renewal in 14h46m57s
INFO: 2019/06/21 03:14:23 certificate renewed, next in 15h17m31s
INFO: 2019/06/21 18:31:00 certificate renewed, next in 14h33m17s
ERROR: 2019/06/22 11:04:39 error renewing certificate: client POST https://localhost/renew failed: Post https://localhost/renew: dial tcp [::1]:443: connect: connection refused
INFO: 2019/06/22 11:05:00 certificate renewed, next in 14h33m17s
```

The default behavior in this mode is to wait until two-thirds of the certificate lifetime has passed (e.g., 16 hours for a 24 hours certificate) then attempt a renewal. Some jitter is added to this schedule to prevent a thundering herd of renewals sent to the CA by many VMs that were provisioned at the same time.

If renewal fails (e.g., if the CA is down) `step` will retry periodically ahead of expiration. Thus, the default behavior of `step certificates` makes an outage of less than one-third of your certificate lifetime (8 hours for a 24 hour lifetime) non-critical. The system will recover on its own.

In many cases, workloads read certificates from disk at startup and will not notice that a renewal has occurred. To assist in these situations, the `--exec` flag tells `step ca renew` to execute a command after each renewal. This can be used to restart a process, or a send a signal to a process telling it to reload its certificate.

```bash
foo$ step ca renew --force --daemon --exec "kill -HUP $NGINX_PID" foo.crt foo.key
```

Alternatively, your workloads can be written to watch for filesystem changes or simply read the certificate file from disk periodically (e.g., every minute).

### Revoking a certificate

Currently, `step certificates` does not support _active revocation_ mechanisms like CRL or OCSP. These features are on the roadmap, but even with infrastructure support they are challenging to implement properly.

Instead, `step certificates` is designed to make _passive revocation_ easy. Rather than actively marking a certificate as revoked, and relying on each workload to notice and enforce the revocation, you can mark a certificate as revoked _at the CA_. The CA will not renew a revoked certificate, allowing the certificate will naturally expire:

```bash
foo$ step ca revoke --cert foo.crt --key foo.key
Certificate with Serial Number 288091591401471633502642677501112605368 has been revoked.

foo$ step ca renew --force foo.crt foo.key
error renewing certificate: Unauthorized
```

### Federation

Suppose `foo.internal` is running in AWS and `bar.internal` is running in GCP. To communicate, traffic must transit the public internet. Traditionally this sort of cross-connectivity is secured using a network-level tunnel (e.g., an SSN tunnel or a VPN). These tunnels are often configured and managed ad-hoc. They're also hard to scale, hard to operate, and can introduce a single-point of failure into an otherwise resilient system.

With good automated certificate management you can leverage mTLS for secure cross-connectivity without a VPN.

In this scenario, you may want to run two CAs: one in AWS and one in GCP. That way you don't need to expose `step-ca` to the public internet. To make this work these CAs must federate -- `foo.internal` and `bar.internal` must trust both CAs to issue certificates.

The `step ca federate` subcommand can be used to setup this federation, and `step ca` works to distribute the bundle of federated roots to workloads in both clouds.
