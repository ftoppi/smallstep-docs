## Usage

```raw
step crypto nacl box open <nonce> <sender-pub-key> <priv-key>

## Description

Authenticate and decrypt a box produced by seal using the specified KEY. If
PRIV_KEY is encrypted you will be prompted for the password. The sealed box is

encoding. e.g. base64:081D3pFPBkwx1bURR9HQjiYbAUxigo0Z

`sender-pub-key`
The path to the public key of the peer that produced the sealed box.

`priv-key`
The path to the private key used to open the box.
