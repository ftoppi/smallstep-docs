## Name
**step ssh login** -- adds a SSH certificate into the authentication agent

## Usage

```raw
step ssh login <identity>
[--token=<token>] [--provisioner=<name>] [--provisioner-password-file=<file>]
[--not-before=<time|duration>] [--not-after=<time|duration>]
[--set=<key=value>] [--set-file=<path>]
[--force] [--ca-url=<uri>] [--root=<file>]
[--offline] [--ca-config=<path>]
```

## Description

**step ssh login** generates a new SSH key pair and send a request to [step
certificates](https://github.com/smallstep/certificates) to sign a user
certificate. This certificate will be automatically added to the SSH agent.

With a certificate servers may trust only the CA key and verify its signature on
a certificate rather than trusting many user keys.

## Positional arguments

`identity`
The certificate identity. If no principals are passed we will use
the identity as a principal, if it has the format abc@def then the
principal will be abc.

## Options


**--token**=`token`
The one-time `token` used to authenticate with the CA in order to create the
certificate.

**--add-user**
Create a user provisioner certificate used to create a new user.

**--identity**=`value`
The certificate identity. It is usually passed as a positional argument, but a
flag exists so it can be configured in $STEPPATH/config/defaults.json.

**--provisioner**=`name`, **--issuer**=`name`
The provisioner `name` to use.

**--provisioner-password-file**=`file`, **--password-file**=`file`
The path to the `file` containing the password to decrypt the one-time token
generating key.

**--not-before**=`time|duration`
The `time|duration` when the certificate validity period starts. If a `time` is
used it is expected to be in RFC 3339 format. If a `duration` is used, it is a
sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such
as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms",
"s", "m", "h".

**--not-after**=`time|duration`
The `time|duration` when the certificate validity period ends. If a `time` is
used it is expected to be in RFC 3339 format. If a `duration` is used, it is a
sequence of decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix, such
as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms",
"s", "m", "h".

**--set**=`key=value`
The `key=value` pair with template data variables to send to the CA. Use the **--set** flag multiple times to add multiple variables.

**--set-file**=`path`
The `path` of a JSON file with the template data to send to the CA.

**--ca-url**=`URI`
`URI` of the targeted Step Certificate Authority.

**--root**=`file`
The path to the PEM `file` used as the root certificate authority.

**--offline**
Creates a certificate without contacting the certificate authority. Offline mode
uses the configuration, certificates, and keys created with **step ca init**,
but can accept a different configuration file using **--ca-config** flag.

**--ca-config**=`path`
The `path` to the certificate authority configuration file. Defaults to
$STEPPATH/config/ca.json

**-f**, **--force**
Force the overwrite of files without asking.

## Examples

Request a new SSH certificate and add it to the agent:
```shell
$ step ssh login joe@example.com
```

Request a new SSH certificate valid only for 1h:
```shell
$ step ssh login --not-after 1h joe@smallstep.com
```
