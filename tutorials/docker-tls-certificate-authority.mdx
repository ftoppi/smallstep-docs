This guide will illustrate how to run `step-ca` inside a Docker container,
issue TLS certificates to Docker containers, and manage the lifecycle of
TLS certificates using `step`, certificates. As an example, you will send
secure communications between a standalone webserver and curl.

## About this tutorial

- Learn how to Bootstrap and run a private X.509 online certificate authority in a docker container.
- Examples include copy/paste code blocks and the smallstep docker image.
- When complete, you will have a fully functioning certificate authority. 
- Estimated effort: Reading time ~4 mins, Lab time ~20 to 60 mins.

## Requirements

- This tutorial assumes you have initialized and started up a `step-ca` instance using the steps in [Getting Started](/docs/step-ca/getting-started). As an alternative, you can use our hosted CA, [Smallstep Certificate Manager](/certificate-manager)
- Python 2.7.x interpreter to bring up standalone webserver (optional)

- [Setting Up a Development Environment](#setting-up-a-development-environment)


## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Pull down the Docker image

Get the latest version of `step-ca` from the [`step-ca` Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/smallstep/step-ca):

```shell
docker pull smallstep/step-ca
```

### 2. Create the required volumes

We need to create a volume in Docker where we will store our PKI as well as the `step-ca` configuration file.

```shell
docker volume create step
```

### 3. Bring up PKI bootstrapping container

The simple way to do this is to run an interactive terminal:

```shell
docker run -it -v step:/home/step smallstep/step-ca sh
```

### 4. Run `step` initialization command

Inside the container command prompt, run this:
  
<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="step ca init">
{`$ step ca init
âœ” What would you like to name your new PKI?: Smallstep
âœ” What DNS names or IP addresses would you like to add to your new CA? localhost
âœ” What address will your new CA listen at?: :9000
âœ” What would you like to name the first provisioner for your new CA?: admin
âœ” What do you want your password to be?: <your password here>
 
Generating root certificate...
all done!
 
Generating intermediate certificate...
all done!
 
âœ” Root certificate: /home/step/certs/root_ca.crt
âœ” Root private key: /home/step/secrets/root_ca_key
âœ” Root fingerprint: f9e45ae9ec5d42d702ce39fd9f3125372ce54d0b29a5ff3016b31d9b887a61a4
âœ” Intermediate certificate: /home/step/certs/intermediate_ca.crt
âœ” Intermediate private key: /home/step/secrets/intermediate_ca_key
âœ” Default configuration: /home/step/config/defaults.json
âœ” Certificate Authority configuration: /home/step/config/ca.json
 
Your PKI is ready to go. To generate certificates for individual services see 'step help ca`}
</CodeBlock>

### 5. Place the PKI root password in a known safe location.

Our image is expecting the password to be placed in `/home/step/secrets/password`. You can simply bring up the shell prompt in the container again and write that file:

```shell
docker run -it -v step:/home/step smallstep/step-ca sh
```

Write the file into the expected location:

```shell
echo <your password here> > /home/step/secrets/password
```

Everything is ready to run `step-ca` inside your container!

## Running `step-ca` Inside a Container

Now that we have configured our environment we are ready to run `step-ca`.
Expose the server address locally and run the `step-ca` with:

```shell
docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:9000:9000 -v step:/home/step smallstep/step-ca
```

Let's verify that the service is running with curl:

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="curl https://localhost:9000/health"
>
{`$ curl https://localhost:9000/health
curl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate
More details here: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
 
curl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a "bundle"
 of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs). If the default
 bundle file isn\'t adequate, you can specify an alternate file
 using the --cacert option.
If this HTTPS server uses a certificate signed by a CA represented in
 the bundle, the certificate verification probably failed due to a
 problem with the certificate (it might be expired, or the name might
 not match the domain name in the URL).
If you\'d like to turn off curl\'s verification of the certificate, use
 the -k (or --insecure) option.
HTTPS-proxy has similar options --proxy-cacert and --proxy-insecure.`}
</CodeBlock>

It's working but curl complains because the certificate is not signed by an well known public certificate authority.

## Setting Up a Development Environment

To initialize the development environment we need to grab the root fingerprint from step 4 in this tutorial. In the case of this example: `f9e45ae9ec5d42d702ce39fd9f3125372ce54d0b29a5ff3016b31d9b887a61a4`. With the root certificate's fingerprint we can bootstrap our dev environment.

<CodeBlock
  language="shell-session"
  copyText="step ca bootstrap --ca-url https://localhost:9000 --install --fingerprint <your fingerprint>"
>
{`$ step ca bootstrap --ca-url https://localhost:9000 --install --fingerprint f9e45ae9ec5d42d702ce39fd9f3125372ce54d0b29a5ff3016b31d9b887a61a4
The root certificate has been saved in ~/.step/certs/root_ca.crt.
Your configuration has been saved in ~/.step/config/defaults.json.
Installing the root certificate in the system truststore... done.`}
</CodeBlock>

Now your local `step` CLI is configured to use the container instance of `step-ca` and our new root certificate is trusted by our local environment (inserted into local trust store).

<CodeBlock language="shell-session" copyText="curl https://localhost:9000/health">
{`$ curl https://localhost:9000/health
{"status":"ok"}`}
</CodeBlock>

Now we are able to run web services configured with TLS (and mTLS):

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca certificate localhost localhost.crt localhost.key
âœ” Key ID: aTPGWP0qbuQdflR5VxtNouDIOXyNMH1H9KAZKP-UcHo (admin)
âœ” Please enter the password to decrypt the provisioner key:
âœ” CA: https://localhost:9000/1.0/sign
âœ” Certificate: localhost.crt
âœ” Private Key: localhost.key

$ step ca root root_ca.crt
The root certificate has been saved in root_ca.crt.
```

Here's a standalone Python example to launch a web server secured by HTTPS using above's certificate:

```python
import BaseHTTPServer, ssl

class H(BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200); self.send_header('content-type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8'); self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b'\n\xf0\x9f\x91\x8b Hello! Welcome to TLS \xf0\x9f\x94\x92\xe2\x9c\x85\n\n')

httpd = BaseHTTPServer.HTTPServer(('', 8443), H)
httpd.socket = ssl.wrap_socket (httpd.socket, server_side=True, keyfile="localhost.key", certfile="localhost.crt", ca_certs="root_ca.crt")
httpd.serve_forever()
```

Then you can test your certificate from another terminal:

<CodeBlock
    language="shell-session"
    copyText="https://localhost:8443"
  >{`$ curl https://localhost:8443
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to TLS ðŸ”’âœ…`}</CodeBlock>

Or visit https://localhost:8443 from your browser.
