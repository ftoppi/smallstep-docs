`step-ca` integrates with a number of different protocols and platforms. Many 
of these integrations are native to `step-ca` (like support for [ACME][acme-rfc]
and [OIDC][oidc]), while others require additional tools from the smallstep 
library (e.g. [autocert][autocert]).

This document lists, briefly describes, and links to documentation for all 
`step-ca` integrations.

### ACME

Both `step` and `step-ca` are natively integrated with the [ACME protocol][acme-rfc]. `step`
can be used to request ACME certificates from any ACME server, while `step-ca` 
is a fully functional private ACME server that works with all popular ACME clients.

Learn more about how to [setup your own private ACME server][private-acme-server] and [configure 
popular ACME clients to use that server][configure-acme].

[private-acme-server]: /docs/tutorials/private-acme-server
[configure-acme]: /docs/tutorials/acme-client-configuration

### OIDC

Both `step` and `step-ca` natively support working with and issuing 
credentials in exchange for OIDC tokens.

Learn more about how to [configure an OIDC provisioner][configure-oidc].

[configure-oidc]: /docs/step-ca/configuration#oauthoidc-single-sign-on

### Cloud Key Management Service

Cloud Key Management Services (Cloud KMS) allow users to store cryptographic 
keys and sign certificates using cloud storage and APIs.

Google Cloud KMS and Amazon AWS KMS are currently supported. An experimental version for YubiKey PIV is also available.

Learn more about how to [configure Cloud KMS][configure-cloudkms].

[configure-cloudkms]: /docs/step-ca/configuration#cloud-key-management-service

### Cloud Instance Identity

Cloud Instance Identity Documents (IIDs) are cryptographically signed blobs of
information about a host that are often used by workloads to authenticate one another
across one's infrastructure.

Both `step` and `step-ca` natively support working with and issuing 
credentials in exchange for IIDs from AWS, GCP, and Azure.

Learn more about how to [configure a cloud identity document provisioner][configure-iid].

[configure-iid]: /docs/step-ca/configuration#cloud-provisioners

### Kubernetes: `autocert`

`autocert` is a kubernetes add-on that automatically injects TLS/HTTPS certificates into your containers.

Learn more about how to [install and configure `autocert`][autocert].

### Envoy Secret Discovery Service (SDS): `step-sds`

`step-sds` implements the server-side API of [Envoy SDS][envoy-sds], which
pushes certificates to the client. Both mTLS and Unix Domain Socket
configurations are supported.

Learn more about how to [install and configure `step-sds`][step-sds].

### YubiKey PIV

Want to store your CA locally on a YubiKey? Experimental support for YubiKey's PIV application is available. [Learn more.](/docs/step-ca/configuration#yubikey)
