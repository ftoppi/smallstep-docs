This document defines and describes certificate authority core concepts that are integral to the design
and practical usage of `step-ca`.

## Online and Offline X.509 Certificate Authority

Certificate Authorities (CAs) tend to be either "online" or "offline" mode.


When referring to Certificate Authorities (CAs), _offline_ generally means
air-gapped or network isolated. However, the term _offline_ has a different
meaning in the context of `step-ca`. When `step-ca` is online (using the
`step-ca` server) it is responding to network requests. But `step-ca` can
also operate "offline", without the `step-ca` server, by accessing the signing
keys locally. We call this static, non-daemonized operation _offline mode_. Any
further use of the term _offline_ in these docs will refer to _offline mode_ in
the context of `step-ca` (local access only).

Our tools support three modes of generating and operating a Certificate Authority (CA):
* An online database-backed CA, using the `step-ca` daemon and `step ca` subcommand ([docs here][stateful-ca]).
* A local (or airgapped) database-backed CA, using the `step ca` subcommand with `--offline`.
* A minimalist, offline, stateless CA, using the `step certificate` subcommand
  ([docs here][stateless-ca]).

### Example: Offline Mode

It's not always practical or desirable to run an online CA.
Smallstep provides the means to create certificates without `step-ca` running.
`step-cli` offline mode leverages the CA's configuration, which must be available locally, to issue certificates.

```shell-session nocopy
$ step ca init --name "Local CA" --provisioner admin --dns localhost --address ":443"
$ step ca certificate --offline foo.smallstep.com foo.crt foo.key
```

## Registration Authority (RA) mode

Sometimes you may wish to run a Registration Authority (RA).
An RA acts as a front-end to a CA, authenticating certificate requests from its clients before passing them along to an upstream Certificate Auothority that will issue the certificates.
This operational mode centralizes and simplifies CA key management, because a single backing CA can serve several RAs.

In RA mode, `step-ca` currently supports two backing CA types: Another `step-ca` instance ("StepCAS"), or Google CloudCAS.

See the [Registration Authority (RA) Mode](configuration#registration-authority-ra-mode) section of our Configuration Guide for more on RA mode.

## Provisioners

The certificate signing API exposed by `step-ca` requires mutual
authentication. The CA authenticates to the client using a certificate (which
the client verifies using the root certificate created during CA initialization). 
But the client must also authenticate to the CA. Again, this
presents a challenge: the client obviously can't use a certificate for
authentication because it doesn't have one yet.

To verify the legitimacy of certificate signing requests, we need some entity
that the CA trusts to measure and attest to the identity of our workloads. In
the _step certificates_ architecture this entity is called a _provisioner_,
because it helps to provision certificates.

In general, once a _provisioner_ authenticates a workload's identity it issues
the workload a _bearer token_ to submit to the CA, along with a [certificate
signing
request](https://smallstep.com/blog/everything-pki.html#certificate-signing-requests
'CSR') (CSR), to obtain a certificate. The _bearer token_ authenticates the
workload and authorizes the certificate request.

The details of how a provisioner interacts with a workload (or device or
person) and the CA vary by provisioner type. Smallstep supports a number of
provisioner types including:

- [ACME protocol](/docs/step-ca/configuration#acme)
- [OAuth/OIDC Single Sign-on](/docs/step-ca/configuration#oauthoidc-single-sign-on)
- [AWS Instance Identity Documents](/docs/step-ca/configuration#aws)
- [Google Cloud Instance Identity Tokens](/docs/step-ca/configuration#gcp)
- [Azure Instance Metadata Service](/docs/step-ca/configuration#azure) 
- [Kubernetes Service Account Tokens](/docs/step-ca/configuration#k8ssa-kubernetes-service-account) 
- [JWT for building custom integrations](/docs/step-ca/configuration#jwt)

## Active vs. passive revocation

On the public internet, sometimes HTTPS certificates need to be revoked before
they expire. Over the years, there have been several methods for _actively
revoking_ HTTPS certificates. Any approach to solving this problem adds
complexity to the PKIâ€”usually in the form of additional network requests. For
example, a web browser might need to fetch a Certificate Revocation List (CRL)
from a URL embedded in an HTTPS certificate so it can make sure the
certificate, which would otherwise be valid, has not been actively revoked by
a trusted authority.

When designing a private PKI, you can make things a lot simpler and more
decentralized. If you make certificate lifetimes short enough, you can
_passively revoke_ a certificate by letting it expire and making sure the
Certificate Authority knows to reject any attempts to renew it.
